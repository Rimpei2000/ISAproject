the idea behind our app is to suggest the users activities to do based on the weather. We have a weather widget where we suggest the type of activitiies. 

We have three different map views, Parks (suggested on sunny days or when the weather is clear), Visit Heritage buildings (suggested on rainy days), and food truck locations (suggested every day :D).

Everything else on our app is function but unfortunately, the hosted app doesn't display the map image(only displays a beige background). We thoroughly looked into it and found that it is a transpiling issue. We tried everything suggested on the official mapbox website and other suggestions provided by people who encountered similar problem. Other than that, the geopins have full functionality. The maps worked perfectly fine on the local server, and it
became obvious to us only after we hosted it.
